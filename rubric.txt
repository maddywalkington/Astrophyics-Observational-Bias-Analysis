Final Project Marks
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
### Clear description of your problem: 5/5

5: Great description of the big picture goals, understandable to a non-specialist, good background
4: Like 5, but with some flaws in one of the three areas above.
3: Adequate descriptions
2: Some serious misconceptions present in the description.
1: Some attempt made
0: No attempt made

### Approach to your problem: 10/10

10: Precisely the right tools to solve the problem at hand
6-9: Generally the right approach but some flaws
5: About a 50/50 balance between approaches that make sense and approaches that don't
1-4: Mostly incorrect approaches, but some reasonable approaches here and there
0: No attempt at a coherent approach to the problem.

### Technical execution: 20/25

15 points for implementation:
15: Correct implementation of what was planned
10: Some mistakes in coding, mostly non-fatal
5: Some serious mistakes that would've affected the results
0: No implementation

10 points for good coding practices:
10: Minimal hardcoding, nice modular code, few unnecessary loops
5: lots of nested loops and hardcoding
0: No effort to code well

Subtract 2 points if there were very few git commits (e.g., all code submitted in one big chunk)

### Documentation and testing: 2/5

3 points for documentation:
3: clear comments and descriptions
2: some commenting and documentation
1: minimal effort
0: no documentation and testing

2 points for testing:
2: evidence of sensible testing
1: badly formulated tests "for the sake of testing"
0: no testing

(Unit tests or docstring tests are ideal, but we'll accept any sort of evidence of testing, e.g., null tests to check that the code is working)

### Presentation of results: 5/5

5: Visually sensible plots that are easy to understand
3: Generally good plots but with some flaws (e.g., missing axis labels)
1: Some effort at presenting results properly.

### Interpretation of results: 10/10

10: Correct interpretation of results without overinterpretatoin
5: Some questionable interpretation
1: Some attempt at interpretation
0: No interpretation

### Creativity + critical thinking: 10/10

See OECD rubric from final project description!
10 points for great creativity/critical thinking in one (or more) categories
5 points for some sort of creativity/critical thinking

### Overall communication: 5/5

5: Writeup presented logically, few typos
3: Some slipups or a disorganized paper
1: Final writeup is a mess
0: Didn't include a writeup

TOTAL: 67/75

General comments
----------------------------------------
--Nice idea to apply cuts to the data to get a more uniform sample. Good critical thinking on that front.
--What's x-bar in Equation 1? Not defined.
